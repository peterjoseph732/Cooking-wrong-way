So basically this project was for my academic internship whcih was my 3rd year where I basically made a food video on unity which basically shows how to cook food thw wrong way or opposite way. 
I did my project this way as I wanted to make it unique and make it a unique way to learn.
I basically created it almost like a normal cooking game but it shows what happens when the steps are wrong.
There was also a right answer choice when the act of making the food wrong has happened.
